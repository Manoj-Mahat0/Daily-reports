Problem of 5 frame of video is resolved. Update the previus API, now it is checking 5 frame and giving no of fake or real. 

### Tasks Completed:
* Created API
* Performed API testing on Postman
* Deployed API on Render

### Online Research and Tutorials
* Not Required

### Setup Instructions
I don't have to install any software for this because I already installed it.
* VS Code
* Python Library
* Postman
* requirement.txt file having all library of python file.
  
### Usage
Deep Fake Detection Using Deep Learning

### Work Progress
All those tasks have been completed successfully.

### Acknowledgments
I completed my tasks on my own in my learning journey.

To check 5  random frame from video and check real or fake image.

### Research:
* Study File Based Data Base
* * Trying To Implementing
  * Google Drive
  * Firebase

### Online Research and Tutorials
* The Fireabse Database link: [https://firebase.google.com/docs]

### Setup Instructions
It is a learning lesson .
* Create account on google console
* Create Gdrive API
* Create Fireabse API
  
### Usage
Deep Fake Detection Using Deep Learning

### Work Progress
Tried, but lots of problems occurred, such as the database filling with images. If multiple users hit the API simultaneously, it will store N frames at different timestamps. This leads to busy scheduling, making it challenging for the system to recognize which frames are coming from which part of the video.
